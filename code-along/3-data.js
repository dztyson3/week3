// Goal: Store my social media profile in memory. Display it in the 
// JavaScript console in Chrome, in a human-readable format.

// A social media profile is a more complex thing â€“ it's not simply
// a String or a Number. It's got many attributes, like a name, location,
// and a timeline.

// Write the recipe (algorithm) in the comments. Then, write the code.

// Store a simple social media profile in memory
let profile = {
    name: `Brian`,
    location: `Chicago`
}
console.log(profile)

// Retrieve the name from the profile, store it in memory
let profileName = profile.name

// Display the name in the console
console.log(`Name: ${profileName}`)

// Retrieve the location, store it in a memory
let profileLocation = profile.location

// Use the location to write the city and state, in a human-readable
// format, to the JavaScript console
console.log(`Location: ${profileLocation.city}, $)

// Write the 3 statuses from the "timeline" to the JavaScript console
